          <h1>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h1>
          <p>
            Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
            browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
            abandoned browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
            achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP,
            and the major browser creators.

            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the
            important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn
            to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
            Become one with the web.

            <h1>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h1>
            <p>
              There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen
              Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To
              begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on
              any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML
              remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
              CSS file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a
              hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way
              that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be,
              once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
              beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed
              to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
            this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example
            files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them
            as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced
            tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
            HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this
            way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the
            sample files as a guide.
          </p>

          <p>
            Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you
            have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit
            half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your
            control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all
            associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it
            and place it on our server.

          <h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>
          <p>
            Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 &
            4 should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
            fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks
            viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
            have is that your CSS validates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
            implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should
            see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to
            the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially
            when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be
            possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many
            as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest
            Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
            population).
          </p>
          <p>
            We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright
            laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to
            incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re
            well past the point of needing another garden-related design.

            This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain
            full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see
            submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a
            Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that
            others may learn from your work.
